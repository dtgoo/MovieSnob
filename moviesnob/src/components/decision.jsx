        You're a Movie Snob. You compare all movies to Citizen Kane and Pulp Fiction. You don't call them movies, you call them "Films" and you miss the days where you can watch in 35mm. You only watch Marvel movies to complain about them later on Reddit, even though you know you secretly loved Thor Ragnorak. <br/>

        You're not a Movie Snob, but you're close. You enjoy good movies, and watch the Oscars - but, sometimes you love a good ole' Adam Sandler or Terry Perry flick. You would die for Baby Groot. La La Land definitely made you cry, and that's okay. <br/>

        Not a movie snob! You don't care what critics say, you like what you like. The Oscars?? those are just your two cousins that were given the same name for some reason. You're really into comedies like Austin Powers and WaterBoy. You're there opening weekend for every new Fast and Furious and you wouldn't have it any other way. <br/>

        You've never even heard of Rotten Tomatoes, besides the ones in your crisper. Not sure how you got this low, unless you watch bad movies as a hobby. Your favorite recent movie is Gotti with John Travolta. That movie is 0% on Rotten Tomatoes...<br/>
